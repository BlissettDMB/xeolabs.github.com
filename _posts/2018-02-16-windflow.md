description:  In New Zealand, I worked with electrical and mechanical engineers to verify that WindowFlow Technology's 500kW turbines generated enough power without falling over or blowing up.<br><br>In this project, my job was to number-crunch terrabyte-sized datasets using procedural SQL and Java to analyse the turbines' power efficiency and structural performance.
