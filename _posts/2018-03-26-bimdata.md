In 2018, I built the WebGL-based 3D BIM viewer for **[BIMData™](http://www.bimdata.io/en/bim-data-en/)**, a cutting-edge platform to manage your construction projects that provides an all-in-one solution to visualize, check, edit and 
share building information. 
<br><br>
For this job, I also subcontracted [David Lenaerts](http://www.derschmale.com/), a freelance graphics programmer, to help out with 
 the math for 3D gizmo interactions.

## The Client

**[BIMData™](http://www.bimdata.io/en/bim-data-en/)** is a company in Nice, France that provides a cutting-edge online platform to manage your construction projects, 
including an all-in-one solution to visualize, check, edit and share building information.

## Requirements
 
 - Implement a WebGL-based viewer to view large 3D IFC models online
 - Load IFC models from glTF   
 - Emphasis effects such as ghosting, highlighting etc.
 - User annotations
 - Cross section views
 - Isolated object views
 - Measurement tools
 - A navigation gizmo similar to AutoDesk ViewCube
 - Orbit, first-person and walking navigation
 
## Solution

 I implemented the BIM viewer as a wrapper class around **[xeogl](http://xeogl.org)**, which is an open source (MIT) library I created for WebGL-based 3D 
 visualization.

 * [Annotations](#annotations)
 * [Cross-section views](#cross-section-views)
 * [ViewCube](#viewcube)
 * [Emphasis effects](#emphasis-effects)
 * [Measurement tools](#measuremenbt-tools)
 
#### Architecture

The viewer is a facade class that wraps xeogl in a set of application-specific functions, and has a plugin architecture 
 into which we can incrementally add various tools and gizmos as we create them.

#### Annotations

Annotations are notes that users pin to the surface of models. These were based on xeogl's experimental [Annotation]() components.

#### Cross-section views

The user can create an unlimited number of custom clipping planes, which can be arranged using mouse/touch input. Clipping 
uses xeogl's native [Clip]() components, which we can interactively arrange using our own fancy editing gizmo.

#### ViewCube

The ViewCube is a 3D camera orientation indicator and controller. I implemented it to look and work the same as the 
Autodesk Research ViewCube. The ViewCube is a 3D object implemented with xeogl, with clickable hotspots that fly the camera 
to various vantage points.

#### Emphasis effects

xeogl has various built-in rendering effects such as ghosting and wireframe, which I'm using for highlighting and 
revealing objects.
