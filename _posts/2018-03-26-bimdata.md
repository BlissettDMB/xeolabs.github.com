In 2018, I developed the WebGL-based 3D BIM viewer within **[BIMData](http://www.bimdata.io/en/bim-data-en/)**, a cutting-edge platform to manage your construction projects that provides an all-in-one solution to visualize, check, edit and 
share building information. 
<br><br>
For this job, I also subcontracted [David Lenaerts](http://www.derschmale.com/), a freelance graphics programmer, to help out with 
 the math for 3D gizmo interactions.

## The Client

**[BIMData](http://www.bimdata.io/en/bim-data-en/)** is a company in Nice, France that provides a cutting-edge online platform to manage your construction projects, 
including an all-in-one solution to visualize, check, edit and share building information.

## Requirements
 
 - Implement a WebGL-based viewer to view large 3D IFC models online
 - Load IFC models from glTF   
 - Emphasis effects such as ghosting, highlighting etc.
 - User annotations
 - Cross section views
 - Isolated object views
 - Measurement tools
 - A navigation gizmo similar to AutoDesk ViewCube
 - Orbit, first-person and walking navigation
 
## Solution

 I implemented the BIM viewer as a wrapper class around **[xeogl](http://xeogl.org)**, which is an open source (MIT) library I created for WebGL-based 3D 
 visualization.
 
#### Architecture

The viewer is a facade class that wraps xeogl in a set of application-specific functions, and has a plugin architecture 
 into which we can incrementally add various tools and gizmos as we create them.

#### Annotations

Annotations are notes that users pin to the surface of models. These were based on xeogl's experimental [Annotation]() components.

#### Cross-section views

The user can create an unlimited number of custom clipping planes, which they can arrange using mouse/touch input. The clip 
 planes use xeogl's native [Clip]() components, which users can interactively arrange using our fancy editing gizmo. This 
 is one of the bits that [David Lenaerts](http://www.derschmale.com/) helped out with.

#### ViewCube

Our ViewCube is a 3D camera orientation indicator and controller. I implemented it to look and work the same as the 
one by Autodesk Research. Our ViewCube is a 3D object implemented with xeogl, with clickable hotspots that fly the camera 
to various vantage points.

#### Emphasis effects

xeogl has some built-in emphasis effects, such as ghosting and wireframe, which we're using for highlighting and 
revealing BIM objects.

#### Measurement tools

#### Camera navigation

#### BCF 

The BIM Collaboration Format (BCF) is an open file format that supports workflow communication in BIM processes. Our BCF system 
captures the complete visual state of the viewer as a JSON BCF record, along with PNG canvas snapshot.
