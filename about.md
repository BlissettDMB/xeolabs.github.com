I'm Lindsay Kay, a software developer based in Berlin whoâ€™s into abstracting high-performance 3D behind user-friendly JavaScript
APIs, so that Web developers can have fun making virtual worlds.
<br><br>
In my day job, I'm the 3D engine guy for the [BioDigital Human](http://biodigitalhuman.com), a medical visualisation
platform, where I work on various bits ranging from WebGL-based graphics through to the developer API.
<br><br>In my spare time I keep things fresh by authoring open source projects like [SceneJS](http://scenejs.org).
