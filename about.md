I'm Lindsay Kay, a software engineer based in Berlin whoâ€™s into abstracting high-performance 3D behind friendly JavaScript
APIs, so that Web developers can have fun making virtual worlds.
<br><br>
In my day job, I'm the engine architect for the [BioDigital Human](http://biodigitalhuman.com), a 3D medical visualisation
platform, where I work on various bits ranging from WebGL-based graphics through to the developer API. In my spare time
I keep things fresh by authoring open source projects like [SceneJS](http://scenejs.org).
