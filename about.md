I'm Lindsay Kay, a software engineer based in Berlin who develops Web-based 3D visualisation systems for healthcare and engineering.
<br><br>
Currently I'm a 3D engine architect on the [BioDigital Human](http://biodigitalhuman.com) team. We make a WebGL-based
medical visualisation platform that brings to life thousands of medically accurate anatomy objects and health conditions.
<br><br>
I'm also working on the latest version of [BIMVie.ws](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/bimvie.ws-viewer), an extensible and
modular WebGL-based 3D viewer for [BIMSurfer](http://bimsurfer.org/).
<br><br>In my spare time I'm keeping things edgy by authoring open source 3D engines like [SceneJS](http://scenejs.org) and [xeoEngine](http://xeoengine.org).
