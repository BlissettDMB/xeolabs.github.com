Hi I'm Lindsay Kay, a freelance software engineer in Berlin, Germany who develops Web-based 3D visualisation software for healthcare and engineering. 
<br><br>I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science from the [University of Canterbury](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/engineering/schools/csse/) in Christchurch, New Zealand.   
<br>Currently, I'm a platform developer/architect on the [BioDigital Human](http://biodigitalhuman.com) team. We make a WebGL-based
3D medical visualisation platform that brings to life thousands of medically accurate anatomy objects and health conditions.
<br><br>In my spare time I'm keeping it edgy by authoring open source WebGL-based 3D engines like [xeogl](http://xeogl.org) and [SceneJS](http://scenejs.org).
