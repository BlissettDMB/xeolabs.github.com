I'm Lindsay Kay, a software engineer based in Berlin who develops Web-based 3D visualisation systems for healthcare and engineering.
<br><br>
Currently I'm a 3D engine developer on the [BioDigital Human](http://biodigitalhuman.com) team. We make a WebGL-based
medical visualisation platform that brings to life thousands of medically accurate anatomy objects and health conditions.
<br><br>
I'm also working on the WebGL-based viewer for [BIMSurfer](http://bimsurfer.org/), an extensible and
modular open-source WebGL-based 3D viewer for the visualisation of IFC/BIM models.
<br><br>In my spare time I'm keeping things edgy by authoring open source 3D engines like [SceneJS](http://scenejs.org) and [xeoogl](http://xeogl.org).
