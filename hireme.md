I'm a freelance 3D software engineer using WebGL for Web-based visualization. Get
in touch if your project requires an experienced engineer with a track
record of delivering successful WebGL-based solutions for BIM, Medical
Visualization and CAD.

### Process

* Starts with a meeting or two, then we'll need to formalize things.
* NDA is usually OK, if needed. Best if that's focused on business strategy, or techniques that are not generic.
* Client then provides a specification.
* Then I respond with a proposal. I've found it useful to share specs and proposals as Google Drive documents, that we can clarify, if necessary, via annotated comments.
* Contract
* Implement!

## Time tracking

I've found [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) great for time tracking. It lets me share time sheets with clients monthly, weekly or even daily, depending on how much progress visibility is required.

## Source code

* It's often useful to host source code within a private repository at GitHub, to which we both have access. to be great for hosting projects
* GitHub - priivate repository
* Can use GitHub issue tracker, can also instead use Jira

## Resources

* Can subcontract additional developers for WebGL, UX etc
* Can build solutions on in-house OSS frameworks
