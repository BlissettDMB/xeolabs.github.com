<br>I'm a freelance 3D software engineer developing WebGL-based solutions for product visualization, MedViz, BIM and CAD.<br><br>
Originally from Christchurch, New Zealand, I've lived in Berlin, Germany since 2011.<br><br>
I graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Canterbury in 2005. Before that, I studied electronic engineering at the Christchurch Polytechnic.<br><br>
Some things I've done:

* Built the core WebGL rendering technology from scratch for the **[BioDigital Human](./portfolio/biodigital-human)** anatomy visualization platform, which now serves over 3 million users  
* Built the **[BimData](http://www.bimdata.io/en/bim-data-en/)** and **[BIMSurfer](http://bimsurfer.org/)** WebGL-based 3D IFC viewers
* Developed two major open-source WebGL engines, namely **[SceneJS](http://scenejs.org)**, one of the first widely-used WebGL engines, and **[xeogl](http://xeogl.org)**, which is used in several commercial IFC and CAD viewers
* Contributing author on **[OpenGL Insights](pdfs/OpenGLInsights.pdf)**
