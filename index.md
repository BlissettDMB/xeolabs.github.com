<br>I'm a software engineer developing WebGL-based apps for visualizing nerdy things in 3D on the Web.<br><br>
Originally from Christchurch, New Zealand, I've lived in Berlin, Germany since 2011.<br><br>
I graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Canterbury in 2005. Before that, I studied electronic engineering at the Christchurch Polytechnic.<br><br>
Some things I've been up to:

* Built the WebGL-based 3D renderers in the **[BioDigital Human](./portfolio/biodigital-human)**, **[BIMData](./portfolio/bimdata)**, **[BIMSurfer](http://bimsurfer.org/)** and **[SolidComponents](./portfolio/solidcomponents-viewer)** platforms 
* Created two open source WebGL 3D engines: **[xeogl](http://xeogl.org)** and **[SceneJS](http://scenejs.org)**
* Contributing author on **[OpenGL Insights](http://openglinsights.com/)**
