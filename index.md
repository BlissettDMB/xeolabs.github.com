I'm a freelance 3D software engineer providing WebGL-based solutions for product visualization, engineering, medicine and BIM.

### Background

Originally from Christchurch, New Zealand, I've lived in Berlin, Germany since 2011.
<br><br>
I graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Canterbury in 2005. Before that, 
I studied electronic engineering at the Christchurch Polytechnic.
<br><br>
In over two decades of computing, I've taught computing at an elementary school, tutored programming and algorithms at a 
university, been a CTO in San Diego, tested wind turbines in New Zealand, created two production-proven WebGL-based 3D engines, 
lead 3D development on the [BioDigital Human]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/biodigital-human) and the Smiletrain surgical simulator, 
and built two WebGL-based IFC model viewers. For details on those projects, please check out my **[resume](http://linkedin.com/in/lindsaystanleykay)** and **[portfolio]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/)**. 

### Process

As a software engineer, I value process, teamwork, empathy and simple, maintainable design, because those are what make software development fun, healthy and productive. 
<br><br>
As an open source contributor, I often adapt my own experiments and tools to the needs of clients, resulting 
in greater efficiency and certainty of delivery. When more help is needed, I can bring in experienced WebGL 
developers who I've collaborated with on open source projects. 
<br><br>
**Got a project you'd like to discuss?** Fire me an email via the secret address below! Please note that, after the first 
couple of meetings, we'll need to formalize things before moving forward.
