<br>I'm a freelance 3D software engineer developing WebGL-based solutions for product visualization, MedViz, BIM and CAD.<br><br>
Originally from Christchurch, New Zealand, I've lived in Berlin, Germany since 2011.<br><br>
I graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Canterbury in 2005. Before that, I studied electronic engineering at the Christchurch Polytechnic.<br><br>
Some things I've done recently:

* Built the core WebGL rendering technology from scratch for the **BioDigital Human** anatomy visualization platform, which now serves over 3 million users  
* Built the **BimData** and **BIMSurfer** WebGL-based 3D IFC viewers
* Developed two major open-source WebGL engines, including **SceneJS**, one of the first widely-used WebGL engines, and **xeogl**, which is used in several commercial IFC and CAD viewers
* Contributing author on **OpenGL Insights**

<!-- ### Process -->

<!-- As a **software engineer**, I value teamwork, process and simple, maintainable design, because those are what make this  -->
<!-- business fun and profitable.  -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- As an **open source developer**, I collaborate with a diverse community of experienced engineers, adapting our experiments  -->
<!-- and tools to the needs of our clients, resulting in efficient and certain delivery. When projects grow, I can also  -->
<!-- enlist some of those engineers to help out, if needed. -->
 
<!-- ### Community -->
<!-- New to the industry and could use some mentoring? Get in touch - maybe I can help out, or point you to someone who can.  -->


<!-- [^1]: Please note that, after the first couple of meetings, we'd need to formalize things before moving forward. -->
