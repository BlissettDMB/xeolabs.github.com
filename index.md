<br>I'm a freelance software engineer providing WebGL-based solutions for 3D product visualization, MedViz, 
BIM and CAD.<br><br>
For more info, check out my [portfolio]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/) and [resume](http://linkedin.com/in/lindsaystanleykay).<br><br>Got a project you'd like to discuss? Send me an email! 

### Background

Originally from Christchurch, New Zealand, I've lived in Berlin, Germany since 2011.
<br><br>
I graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Canterbury in 2005. Before that, 
I studied electronic engineering at the Christchurch Polytechnic.
<br><br>
Over the past two decades, I've taught computing at a school, tutored software development at a 
university, been a CTO in San Diego, tested wind turbines in New Zealand, created open source WebGL frameworks, 
lead development on the [BioDigital Human]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/biodigital-human), 
and built a bunch of WebGL-based 3D apps that are out there on the Web right now, bringing in revenue for their owners.

### Process

As a **software engineer**, I value teamwork, process and simple, maintainable design, because those are what make this 
business fun and profitable. 
<br><br>
As an **open source developer**, I collaborate with a diverse community of experienced engineers, adapting our experiments 
and tools to the needs of our clients, resulting in efficient and certain delivery. When projects grow, I can also 
enlist some of those engineers to help out, if needed.
 
<!-- ### Community -->
<!-- New to the industry and could use some mentoring? Get in touch - maybe I can help out, or point you to someone who can.  -->


<!-- [^1]: Please note that, after the first couple of meetings, we'd need to formalize things before moving forward. -->
