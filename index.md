I'm a freelance 3D software engineer providing WebGL-based solutions for product visualization, engineering, medicine and BIM.

### Background

Originally from Christchurch, New Zealand, I've lived in Berlin, Germany since 2011.
<br><br>
I graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Canterbury in 2005. Before that, 
I studied electronic engineering at the Christchurch Polytechnic.
<br><br>
Over the last couple of decades, I've taught computing at an elementary school, tutored programming and algorithms at a 
university, been a CTO in San Diego, tested wind turbines in New Zealand, created two open source WebGL-based 3D engines, 
lead 3D development on the [BioDigital Human]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/biodigital-human) and the Smiletrain surgical simulator, 
and built a couple of WebGL-based IFC model viewers. For details on those projects, check out my **[portfolio]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/)** and **[resume](http://linkedin.com/in/lindsaystanleykay)**. 

### Process

As a software engineer, I value process, teamwork, empathy and simple, maintainable design, because those are what make this activity fun, healthy and productive. 
<br><br>
As an open source developer, I draw on the generosity of a lot of passionate graphics geeks. Often, I'll adapt our experiments 
and tools to the needs of my clients, resulting in greater efficiency and certainty of delivery. When more help is needed on a project, 
I can also bring in experienced WebGL geeks who I've collaborated with on various open source projects.

**Got a project you'd like to discuss?** Fire me an email via the secret address below! Please note that, after the first 
couple of meetings, we'll need to formalize things before moving forward.
